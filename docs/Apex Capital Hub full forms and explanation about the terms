Carried Interest (Carry)
The GP’s share of profits, typically 20%, after LPs receive preferred returns.

Catch-Up

In an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram):

1 : N = One-to-Many relationship

Meaning:
👉 One record in the parent entity can be related to many records in the child entity.

Simple Example

1 Fund → Many Commitments

One Fund

Multiple Commitments (one per LP)

Fund (1) ─────────► Commitment (N)

From your Apex Capital Hub ERD

Here are concrete examples:

1. Fund → Commitment (1:N)

One Fund can have many Commitments

Each Commitment belongs to only one Fund

2. Capital Call → Capital Call Line (1:N)

One Capital Call

Many Capital Call Lines (one per LP)

3. Distribution → Distribution Line (1:N)

One Distribution

Many Distribution Lines

4. Investment → Valuation (1:N)

One Investment

Many Valuations over time

How this maps to Salesforce
ERD Relationship	Salesforce Implementation
1:N (One-to-Many)	Lookup or Master-Detail
Strong ownership	Master-Detail
Independent child	Lookup

Example:

Capital Call → Capital Call Line = Master-Detail (child cannot exist without parent)

One-line interview explanation

“1:N means one parent record can be associated with multiple child records, commonly implemented in Salesforce using lookup or master-detail relationships.”

If you want, I can also explain 1:1 and M:N with Salesforce examples.
